            <h2>Ador</h2>
            <img src ="images/ador.jpg" width ="400" alt="Large orange tabby cat with a small narrow face, a tiny tongue, and a long tail.">  
    
            <p>
                Ador is 1 year old. He is a very vocal cat who loves to be petted on his head. 
                Ador enjoys wrestling with his sister Maya, who is a few months older than him. 
                During Ador’s free time, he enjoys looking out the window to see birds and occasionally squirrels in our neighborhood who stop by to say hi to him!
            </p>
            <p> 
                Ador is also very shy and timid. 
                He doesn’t like to be in social situations and tends to hide behind a couch or run down to the basement. 
                Though, once you get to know Ador, he is very affectionate and will often lick your hand when you pet him. 
                Ador’s favorite snack flavors are chicken and turkey, and if you give him enough treats he will thank you for it vocally with his meows! 
            </p>

            <h2>Cheeto (Chicken)</h2>
            <img src="images/cheeto_cattree.jpg" width="400" alt="Orange cat hanging paws off a cat tower">

            <p>Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get
                outside every single day. If he isn't causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and
                sleeping.
            </p>
            <p>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie
                chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six
                years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.
            </p>

            <h2>Leo</h2>
            <img src ="images/Leo_primary_photo.jpg" width ="400" alt="Guinea pig doing his best to smile for the camera">  
            
            <p>
                Guinea pigs are a naturally energetic animal, who spend up to 20 hours a day awake. 
                Despite being awake for long periods of time, they naturally hide in their habitats, and can be difficult to see in their inclosures.  
                Guinea pigs naturally are social creatures that enjoy socializing with other guinea pigs, in the wild they form packs of five to ten.
            </p>
             <p> 
                Leo is a half-lazy, half-lively guinea pig that either likes to run around on the floor, doing tiny hops, 
                or likes to lay down in the cage for hours at a time nibbling at hay. His favorite hobby is eating, and 
                he can tell whenever someone is about to give good to him by waiting at the end of the cardboard box patio he has attached to his cage.
            </p>

            <h2>Milktea</h2>
            <img src ="images/Main.jpg" width ="400" alt="Milktea taking nap">  
        
            <p>
                Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves her veggies and refuses to eat anything dropped on the ground. 
                She makes it clear when she has a demand of any sort by complaining in a loud, distinguished manner. 
                If what she says could be translated, it probably would be, “This is atrocious, the water container has been empty for the 3rd time this week. 
                I want to see the manager.”
            </p>
            <p> 
                Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic disorder intentionally brought upon by humans. 
                I highly advise against keeping a Scottish fold because they are in constant pain when they reach around 2 years old. 
                Cartilage accumulates around her paw joints and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even walk. 
                She is living evidence of human’s cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty while sacrificing the animals’ health.
            </p>

            <h2>Jingle</h2>
            <img src ="images/Jingle.jpg" width ="400" alt="Jingle is a domestic shorthair cat with a white chest and belly and a striped black and gray back. His paws are white and they look like mittens.">  
        
            <p>
                Jingle loves going outside. He used to be an outdoor/indoor cat until we realized that he loved to get injured. 
                Now, we take him on walks with a leash which he loves! 
                Every time he sees me carrying the leash he goes crazy and meows to go out.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Jingle is very mischievous, he has gotten into many different accidents. His first accident was outside; a bee stung his paw and he cried all night long. 
                The second one was ALSO outside, he got stuck on a tree for four days. Finally, he came back home one day with his tail bleeding and ripped out.
            </p>

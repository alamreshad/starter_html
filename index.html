        <h2>Ador</h2>
        <img src ="images/ador.jpg" width ="400" alt="Large orange tabby cat with a small narrow face, a tiny tongue, and a long tail.">  
    
    <p>
        Ador is 1 year old. He is a very vocal cat who loves to be petted on his head. 
        Ador enjoys wrestling with his sister Maya, who is a few months older than him. 
        During Ador’s free time, he enjoys looking out the window to see birds and occasionally squirrels in our neighborhood who stop by to say hi to him!
    </p>
    <p> 
        Ador is also very shy and timid. 
        He doesn’t like to be in social situations and tends to hide behind a couch or run down to the basement. 
        Though, once you get to know Ador, he is very affectionate and will often lick your hand when you pet him. 
        Ador’s favorite snack flavors are chicken and turkey, and if you give him enough treats he will thank you for it vocally with his meows! 
    </p>

            <h2>Cheeto (Chicken)</h2>
            <img src="images/cheeto_cattree.jpg" width="400" alt="Orange cat hanging paws off a cat tower">

            <p>Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get
                outside every single day. If he isn't causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and
                sleeping.
            </p>
            <p>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie
                chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six
                years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.
            </p>
